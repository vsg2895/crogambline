             * at the edge (lib/seo/redirects.ts), so emitting either would mean
             * linking a redirect — one wasted hop per visitor, and, multiplied by
             * the number of categories, a page's worth of crawl budget spent on
             * URLs that resolve elsewhere. It is also what Search Console
             * reported as "Alternate page with proper canonical tag": the home
             * page existed once per category, each copy canonical-tagged at `/`.
             *
             * The chips therefore NAVIGATE rather than filter in place. The
             * destination renders the same list from the same endpoint, under a
             * URL that can be linked, shared and indexed.
