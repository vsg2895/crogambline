     * Content sizing is right on a desktop, where the chips sit in one row and
     * their differing widths read as differing words. On a phone the same rule
     * produced a ragged stack — chips measured 156–187px wide, so some rows
     * held two and some held one and no two edges lined up, which reads as
     * unrelated buttons rather than one set of filters.
     *
     * Two equal columns do not fit: the widest chip needs ~187px and a
     * half-width track at 390px is ~166px, so a nowrap label would be pushed
     * out of its own chip. One column is the honest answer — every chip
     * identical, nothing clipped, and it matches the bonus-type block above it,
     * which is already a single column at this width.
     *
     * A plain block comment, not `{/* … *\/}`: a JSX expression container
     * cannot sit where the returned element goes.

             * linking a redirect — one wasted hop per visitor, and, multiplied by
